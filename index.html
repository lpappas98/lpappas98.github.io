                        During most of my time in college I worked at Cellular Plus Verizon Wireless, One of the most successful verizon companies in the United states.
                        With my previous sales and customer service experience from Simply Mac and Best Buy I excelled at not only solving customers problems but providing them with knowledge to help solve their future problems as well.
                        Providing them with the customer service they needed and selling them on the correct products to make their day to day lives easier. I made lifelong customers for Cellular Plus with customers coming back to specifically work with me.
                        Every month I not only met my sales goals but exceeded them and was typically one of the best performing representatives in the store. When one of our stores hired a new employee I would help train them in not only the software and system side but in helping them with their sales pitches and interactions with customers as well.

                        <h4>Simply Mac</h4>
                        <p>
                        During my freshman year of college I decided to continue my past experience in sales in sales from Best Buy and get a job at Simply Mac, a premiere apple partner that provides customers with service and sales of all Apple products.
                        Ever since I was a little kid I always loved Apple products since I recieved an Ipod Video from my parents as a birthday present. Combining this love of Apple products with sales and customer service experience this was the perfect college job for me.
                        While I worked at simply mac I was the leading sales rep for our store even though I had only a few months experience. My third month working at Simply Mac I not only exceeded my sales goals but was rated the fifth best sales rep for the month of December nationwide.
                        Due to my success in sales and service that month I won a brand new Macbook Pro! After many weeks of training I also recieved Apples certification for servicing all of their mobile devices at the time, this certification was called ACIT.
                        For the rest of my time at Simply Mac I lead my store in sales, assisted customers daily with their service needs making sure they not only get their problems solved but learn new skills with thier Apple products so they can solve their own future issues, and also helped train and lead my store since we were without a manager for multiple months.

                      <h5>RC car controlled using Swift Bluetooth App</h5>
                      <p> In the fall of 2019 I took a general engineering class where multiple disciplines of engineering worked together to build a rc car designed and built completely by our team.</p>

                      <p>My focus in this project was working directly with our teams electrical engineer and program an app to remotely control our car. I decided to use swift as my development platform because of my personal interest in IOS app development and the capabilities of swift as a whole.
                        The first step of building the app was to setup the code to connect the app from my phone to the bluetooth low energy chip. Once the app made the successful bluetooth connection I started to work on the visuals for the app. I made a generic control screen. My largest problem with this project with my limited knowledge of swift and bluetooth control was to access the correct protocol for the chip.
                        After many hours of trying to debug and access the correct protocol for the chip I found a helpful piece of code that was specifically made to connect to a bluetooth device and show each protocol for read/write. This allowed me to determine how to connect to the protocol I needed and correctly connect and control our car.</p>

                      <h5>Comparing the toxicity between esports and traditional sports fanbases</h5>
                      <p> During my Junior year I took a statistics class where my partner <a href = "https://www.linkedin.com/in/reese-pearsall-662084126/" target = "_blank"> Reese Pearsall </a> and I were tasked with going out and doing a study to determine what a group of people think.
                        We decided to do something untraditional for this project due to the fact that most people in the class traditionally go out and ask people questions like "How many cups of coffee do you drink a day?" and we didn't find a study like that very interesting.
                        Combining our knowledge of computer science and statistics we decided to take thousands of comments from multiple different sports and e-sports subreddits to determine which group had a more "toxic" fabbase. To determine which comments would be marked as "toxic" we made a list of words and phrases that were considered curse words.
                        In the end after running multiple python scripts to retrieve the thousands of comments from each subreddit and determine which ones were toxic we had our final results.
                        In the repository below you can find our results, slides from the presentation we gave in our class, and the paper we wrote explaining our process and the in-depth results.</p>
