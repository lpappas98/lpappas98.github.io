									<br>
									<p>
                    I am originally born in Dallas, Texas but have moved around throughout the U.S. my entire life which has given me many great experiences and let me meet amazing people from all around.
                    I have currently lived in Texas, Virginia, New York, and Montana. Over the past 6 years living in Montana I have learned to get out of my shell and enjoy the world arond me.
                    I love to spend time outside with friends going on hikes, roadtrips, and camping! I currently love to workout at the gym and challenge my strength every day to see what new things I can accomplish.
                    My largest athletic goal for 2020-2021 is to train and compete in an Ironman Triathalon!

                        <p>
                        During most of my time in college I worked at Cellular Plus Verizon Wireless, One of the most successful verizon companies in the United states.
                        With my previous sales and customer service experience from Simply Mac and Best Buy I excelled at not only solving customers problems but providing them with knowledge to help solve their future problems as well.
                        Providing them with the customer service they needed and selling them on the correct products they need to make their day to day lives easier I made lifelong customers for cellular Plus with customers coming back to specifically work with me.
                        Every month I not only met my sales goals but exceeeded them and was typically one of the best performing reps in the store. When one of our stores hired a new employee I would help train them in not only the software and system side but in helping them with their sales pitches and interactions with customers as well.

                        <h4>Simply Mac</h4>
                        <p>
                        During my freshman year of college I decided to continue my past experience in sales in sales from Best Buy and get a job at Simply Mac, a premiere apple partner that provides customers with service and sales of all Apple products.
                        Ever since I was a little kid I always loved Apple products since I recieved an Ipod Video from my parents as a birthday present. Combining this love of Apple products with sales and customer service experience this was the perfect college job for me.
                        While I worked at simply mac I was the leading sales rep for our store even though I had only a few months experience. My third month working at Simply Mac I not only exceeded my sales goals but was rated the fifth best sales rep for the month of December nationwide.
                        Due to my success in sales and service that month I won a brand new Macbook Pro! After many weeks of training I also recieved Apples certification for servicing all of their mobile devices at the time, this certification was called ACIT.
                        For the rest of my time at Simply Mac I lead my store in sales, assisted customers daily with their service needs making sure they not only get their problems solved but learn new skills with thier Apple products so they can solve their own future issues, and also helped train and lead my store since we were without a manager for multiple months.
